Time Teller - Age & Wellness Web App
Time Teller is a dynamic web hub developed as part of my CodeAlpha Web Development Internship. This project centers on a Web-based Age Calculator that calculates a userâ€™s age in years, months, and days from their birth date, enhanced with a BMI Calculator and other features for a fun, health-conscious experience.

Features

- Age Calculator: Enter your date of birth (day, month, year) to get an accurate age breakdown in years, months, and days.
- BMI Calculator: Input height and weight to compute your Body Mass Index, promoting health awareness.
- Responsive Design: A clean, user-friendly interface styled with CSS, optimized for all devices.
- Input Validation: Ensures valid entries for dates and measurements, enhancing user experience.
- Interactive UI: Dynamic updates and real-time calculations powered by JavaScript.

Tech Stack
- HTML: Provides the structure for forms and displays.
- CSS: Delivers a responsive, visually appealing design.
